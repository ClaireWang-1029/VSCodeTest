--------------------------------------------
Description:
Events where a transshipment vessel and a fishing vessel were within 500 meters 
of each other for greater than 2 hours, travelling at speeds of less than 2 knots, 
while 10 nautical miles from a coastal anchorage.

There are nine (9) columns.
